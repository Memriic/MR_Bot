MR_bot- A discord bot created by me

Requirements: Python3, pip, Discord

Not required but useful: dotenv

Getting started: You will need to create a bot using the discord developer portal you will also need to pip install and import discord for the API connection.

I would recommend getting dotenv and saving your token in that file, however it is not necessary if you plan to keep the bot running on your local machine only and do not plan to upload it to github.

once you have created your bot you can under OAuth2 you can select the permissions your bot needs and get the link to invite the bot to a server. once done go to the Bot tab and copy your Token. You will place this in a .env file. eg: Token = ygawiushjfgblfkhkjbn. This is to keep the token safe if you plan on uploading it to your own github repository. Otherwise you can place it directly inside the main.py file.

Now you can create any further commands you would like and enjoy your very own customisable discord bot.
